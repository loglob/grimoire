		<h1> Search Options </h1>
		A query consists of search terms linked with the operators <span class="code">;</span>, <span class="code">|</span> and <span class="code">,</span>.
	<br/>
		<span class="code">;</span> and <span span class="code">,</span> are conjunctions, <span class="code">|</span> is a disjunction.
		<span class="code">;</span> binds the weakest and <span class="code">,</span> the strongest.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		Search terms consist of the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="code">ritual</span>, which matches if a spell is a ritual
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="code">concentration</span>, which match if a spell requires concentration
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="code">upcast</span>, which match if a spell has an upcast
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="code">prepared</span>, which match if a spell is prepared (only on spell list page)
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="code">L</span> which matches the spell's level against a value or range.
				For example, <span class="code">L3</span> matches 3rd level spells, and <span class="code">L6-9</span> spells of 6th through 9th level.
			</li>
			<li>
				A verbatim duration value, such as <span class="code">1 minute</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				A verbatim casting time value, such as <span class="code">1 bonus action</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				A spell school, such as <span class="code">enchantment</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				A caster class, such as <span class="code">wizard</span>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Any part of a spell's name. Any spells which have that string contained in their name is matched.
			</li>
			<li>
				A spell's full name, prefixed by <span class="code">\</span>.
				For example, <span class="code">\shield</span> matches <i>Shield</i> but not <i>Shield of Faith</i>.
			</li>
            <li>
                Any of the above, prefixed with <span class="code">!</span>.
                Matches only spells which aren't matched by the following search term.
            </li>
		</ul>
		Even if one of these cases match, all others are tried anyways.
		In particular, any term used is tested against the spells' names.
        The same applies to how <span class="code">!</span> search terms are matched.
	<br/>
		All search terms are case-insensitive and any whitespace is trimmed and squeezed.
