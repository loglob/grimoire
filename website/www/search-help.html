		<h1> Search Options </h1>
		A query consists of search terms linked with the operators <span class="code">;</span>, <span class="code">|</span> and <span class="code">,</span>.
	<br/>
		<span class="code">;</span> and <span span class="code">,</span> are conjunctions, <span class="code">|</span> is a disjunction.
		<span class="code">;</span> binds the weakest and <span class="code">,</span> the strongest.
	<br/>
	<br/>
		Search terms consist of the following:
		<h3>For all Games</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<span class="code">prepared</span>, which matches if a spell is currently prepared (only on spell list page)
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="code">$</span> followed by any part of a spell's material components,
				which matches if a spell's material components contain that string.
			</li>

		</ul>

		Even if one of these cases match, all others are tried anyways.
		In particular, any term used is tested against the spells' names.
		The same applies to how <span class="code">!</span> search terms are matched.
	<br/>
		Text matches are case-insensitive and any whitespace is trimmed and squeezed.
